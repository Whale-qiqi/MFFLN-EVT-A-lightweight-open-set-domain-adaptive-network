ðŸŒŸ Overview

MFFLN-EVT is an open-set domain adaptation framework designed for cross-domain unknown fault diagnosis of chiller systems.
It integrates a Multi-level Feature Fusion Lightweight Network (MFFLN) with Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to achieve high diagnostic accuracy and efficient deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

ðŸš€ Motivation

In real-world chiller operation:

Strong coupling among system components leads to complex, correlated data distributions.

This blurs fault boundaries and increases the difficulty of identifying unknown faults.

Existing deep learning models are computationally expensive, limiting their edge deployment.

To address these challenges, MFFLN-EVT provides:
âœ… Lightweight architecture for efficient inference
âœ… Open-set adaptability for unseen fault detection
âœ… Pseudo-label weighted adversarial learning for robust domain alignment
âœ… EVT-based decision boundary modeling for identifying unknown classes

ðŸ§© Methodology

Data Transformation:
Convert one-dimensional sequential chiller data into grayscale images to enhance spatial structural representation.

Multi-level Feature Fusion Lightweight Network (MFFLN):
Extracts multi-scale local and global features efficiently through depthwise separable convolution and multi-branch fusion.

Adversarial Domain Adaptation:
Aligns source and target feature distributions using pseudo-label weighted adversarial training, improving classification robustness under domain shifts.

Extreme Value Theory (EVT):
Models feature distributions near decision boundaries to detect unknown fault samples beyond the known class space.

ðŸ“Š Experimental Results

Datasets: Two independent chiller datasets

Average Accuracy:

Dataset I: 88.28%

Dataset II: 88.22%

Performance: Outperforms existing domain adaptation and fault diagnosis baselines, demonstrating superior open-set adaptability and engineering applicability.
